Bagels expense tracker is a TUI application where you can track and analyse your money flow, with convenience oriented features and a complete interface.

> **Why an expense tracker in the terminal?**
> I found it easier to build a habit and keep an accurate track of my expenses if I do it at the end of the day, instead of on the go. So why not in the terminal where it's fast, and I can keep all my data locally?

- Accounts, (Sub)Categories, Splits, Transfers, Records
- Templates for Recurring Transactions

- Label, amount and category filtering
- Spending plottings / graphs with estimated spendings
- Budgetting tool for saving money and limiting unnecessary spendings

## Installation

MacOS:

```bash
# install uv (package manager):
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# restart your terminal, or run the following command:
source $HOME/.local/bin/env # or follow instructions

# install bagels through uv
uv tool install --python 3.13 bagels
```

Windows:

```bash
# install uv:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
# then follow instructions to add uv to path
uv tool install --python 3.13 bagels
```

Usage:

```bash
bagels # start bagels
bagels --at "./" # start bagels with data stored at cd
bagels locate database # find database file path
bagels locate config # find config file path
```

> It is recommended, but not required, to use "modern" terminals to run the app. MacOS users are recommended to use Ghostty, and Windows users are recommended to use Windows Terminal.

To upgrade:

```bash
uv tool upgrade bagels
```

## Development setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EnhancedJax/Bagels.git
cd Bagels
uv run pre-commit install
mkdir instance
uv run bagels --at "./instance/" # runs app with storage in ./instance/
# alternatively, use textual dev mode to catch prints
uv run textual run --dev "./src/bagels/textualrun.py"
uv run textual console -x SYSTEM -x EVENT -x DEBUG -x INFO # for logging
```
